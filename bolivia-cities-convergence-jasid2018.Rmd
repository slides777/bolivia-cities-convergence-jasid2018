# Motivation and Main Objective

- Bolivia has experienced fast urbanization and metropolization in last decades:

  - By  2013, 46 % of the population are concentrated in 20 metropolitan regions 
    
    - Out of 339 regions/municipalities, that is just under 6 % !!!
  
- Study the evolution of human development disparities across the core metropolitan regions of Bolivia

  1. In a context of slow economic growth: 1992-2001 period
  
  2. In a context of fast economic growth: 2001-2013 period
  

# Methods and Data

- Nonparametric density estimation methods: Distribution dynamics framework (Quah 1997; Johnson 2005).

- Humand Development Index of a sample of 20 core metropolitan regions for the years 1992, 2001, 2013 (UNDP, 2016).

# Results

1. An **"average" tendency towards regional convergence** driven by two forces:

  - Forward mobility of the less developed regions
  
  - Backward mobility of the more developed regions.

## Further insights from the distribution dynamics framework:

1. **Regional heterogeneity matters**, let's investigate beyond the "average"

2. **Clustering dynamics** notoriously different across growth regimes:

  - Slow growth period: three separate clusters of regions
  
  - Fast growth period: fusion/merge between the central cluster and the high-development cluster 

3. **The long-run (equilibrium) distribution** of human development in Bolivia is quite **sticky and assymetric at its left tail**

  - In equilibrium, least developed regions are still relatively far from achieving complete convergence.
    
      - Implication: **Focalization of policies** at the regional level

# Outline of this presentation

1. Key insights from the distribution dynamics framework

    - Go beyond the "average"
    - The dynamics of the entire distribution provide new valuable information:
        - nonlinear convergence
        - convergence clusters
        - long-run equilibrium 

2. Overview of results  

    - "Average" tendency towards convergence
    - Clustering dynamics across growth regimes and nonlinear convergence
    - Sticky and assymetric distribution of human development in the long run 

3. Concluding remarks

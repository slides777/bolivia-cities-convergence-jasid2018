# Motivation and Main Objective

- Bolivia has experienced fast urbanization and metropolization in last decades:

  - By  2013, 46 % of the population are concentrated in 20 metropolitan regions 
    
    - Out of 339 regions/municipalities, that is just under 6 % !!!
  
- Study the evolution of human development disparities across the core metropolitan regions of Bolivia

  1. In a context of slow economic growth: 1992-2001 period
  
  2. In a context of fast economic growth: 2001-2013 period
  

# Methods and Data

- Nonparametric density estimation methods: Distribution dynamics framework (Quah 1997; Johnson 2005).

- Humand Development Index of a sample of 20 core metropolitan regions for the years 1992, 2001, 2013 (UNDP, 2016).

# Results

1. An "average" tendency towards regional convergence driven by two forces:

  - (Relative) Forward mobility of the less developed regions
  
  - (Relative) Backward mobility of the more developed regions.

## Further insights from the distribution dynamics framework:

1. Regional heterogeneity matters, let's investigate beyond the "avarage"

2. Clustering dynamics notoriosly different across growth regimes:

  - Slow growth period: three separate clusters of regions
  
  - Fast growth period: fusion/merge between the central cluster and the high-development cluster 

3. The distribution of human development in Bolivia is quite sticky at its left tail

  - Least developed regions are still relatively far from achieving complete convergence in the long run.
    
      - Implication: Focalization of policies at the regional level

## For the premature deindustrialization hypothesis:

  - $Industrialization = f(+GDP, -GDP^2, (?)Controls)$
  
  - The peak of the inverted-U has declined (only for employment)
  
  - The turning point has declined (for both employment and output)
  
  - More notorious for South Asia

**Implication/warning:**

- Premature deindustrialization in Asia may decrease the growth rates of middle-income countries
